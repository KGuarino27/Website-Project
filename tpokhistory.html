    <h1>The History of Trash Pandas of Kaunokka</h1>

                Part 1<br>
                <br>
                We laid our roots, in Kaunokka we found,<br>
                a place to call home, with new friends inbound.<br>
                <br>
                Our foundation was built, by those few founders,<br>
                a brand new sanctuary, for any new members.<br>
                <br>
                Our beginnings were slow, and always humble,<br>
                we sided with Discord, much better than Mumble.<br>
                <br>
                Kaunokka was safe, as it could be in EVE,<br>
                miners saught shelter, and a brief repreive.<br>
                <br>
                Missions were easy, with a hub next door,<br>
                flying together, they were never a bore.<br>
                <br>
                Then came the Trigs, their guns already drawn,<br>
                looking to take Kaunokka, to begin a new dawn.<br>
                <br>
                We put up a fight, the very best we could,<br>
                joined new allies, side-by-side we stood.<br>
                <br>
                This new enemy was strong, and its supporters rallied,<br>
                Many ships were lost, many corpses were carried.<br>
                <br>
                Until the moment came, where there was no return,<br>
                Kaunokka was lost, it had begun to burn.<br>
                <br>
                As the dust settled, the red haze appeared,<br>
                urgent notice to evacuate, we quickly adhered.<br>
                <br>
                The losses were great, New Eden was changed,<br>
                Kaunokka gone forever, a new home to be staged.<br>
                <br>
                Our time would come, we had to believe,<br>
                when we would rise once more, because this is EVE.<br></p>

                Part 2<br>
                <br>
                Our time had come, we knew it would,<br>
                we put so much in, tears, sweat and blood.<br>
                <br>
                We had found our new home, temporary at first,<br>
                but soon came the desire, the lust and the thirst.<br>
                <br>
                To build a new hub, where new players are welcome,<br>
                we give them a ship, and a community to greet them.<br>
                <br>
                It started out, with only a few,<br>
                but with hard work, it grew and grew.<br>
                <br>
                We had moved on, from our time in Kaunokka,<br>
                to rebuild this corp, right here in Umokka.<br>
                <br>
                Umokka had, everything that we needed,<br>
                missions and mining, even skills books were seeded.<br>
                <br>
                More and more friends, joined by the day,<br>
                our corp has become, a great place to stay.<br>
                <br>
                Our members are, the living soul of our corp,<br>
                whether their time with us, is long or short.<br>
                <br>
                But it is important for us, that they all know,<br>
                the history of TPoK, that no book will show.<br>
                <br>
                How the Triglavians came to High Sec,  raging war on us all,<br>
                our decision to fight, and answer the call.<br>
                <br>
                The struggles we overcame, the challenges we faced,<br>
                the battles we lost, that left a bitter taste.<br>
                <br>
                When all was done, and Kaunokka was lost,<br>
                to Pochven it went, while we counted the cost.<br>
                <br>
                But this is all, now in our past,<br>
                we live and learn, and we do both fast.<br>
                <br>
                Our focus now, is building upon,<br>
                the foundations we laid, in the years now gone.<br>
                <br>
                Trash Pandas of Kaunokka, remember the name,<br>
                The greatest corp in New Eden, our boldest claim.<br>
                <br>
                There are still goals, that we aim to achieve,<br>
                but we know we can get there, because this is EVE.<br></p>
