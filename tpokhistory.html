        <h1>The History of Trash Pandas of Kaunokka</h1>
        <p class="ptext2">
            We laid our roots, in Kaunokka we found,<br>
            a place to call home, with new friends inbound.<br>
            <br>
            Our foundation was built, by those few founders,<br>
            a brand new sanctuary, for any new members.<br>
            <br>
            Our beginnings were slow, and always humble,<br>
            we sided with Discord, much better than Mumble.<br>
            <br>
            Kaunokka was safe, as it could be in EVE,<br>
            miners saught shelter, and a brief repreive.<br>
            <br>
            Missions were easy, with a hub next door,<br>
            flying together, they were never a bore.<br>
            <br>
            Then came the Trigs, their guns already drawn,<br>
            looking to take Kaunokka, to begin a new dawn.<br>
            <br>
            We put up a fight, the very best we could,<br>
            joined new allies, side-by-side we stood.<br>
            <br>
            This new enemy was strong, and its supporters rallied,<br>
            Many ships were lost, many corpses were carried.<br>
            <br>
            Until the moment came, where there was no return,<br>
            Kaunokka was lost, it had begun to burn.<br>
            <br>
            As the dust settled, the red haze appeared,<br>
            urgent notice to evacuate, we quickly adhered.<br>
            <br>
            The losses were great, New Eden was changed,<br>
            Kaunokka gone forever, a new home to be staged.<br>
            <br>
            Our time would come, we had to believe,<br>
            when we would rise once more, because this is EVE.<br></p>
