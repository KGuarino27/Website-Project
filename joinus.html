            <h2>Benefits of being a Trash Panda</h2>
            <p>Being a member of TPoK means you become a part of our community.<br>
                <br>
                We have members from all over the world and our 80+ members are always happy to help whenever you should need it,  both in-game and on our Discord server.<br>
            <br>
            We hold regular mission running and mining fleets, that are open to all members of our corp.  There is always a role for everyone,  no matter how experienced you may or may not be.<br>
            <br>
            Prefer the industrial path? No problem.  Jump in your mining ship of choice and join one of our ore or ice mining fleets, with free boosts and compression.  We have thousands of BPC's available too if the manufacturing route is the way you want to go.  Just speak to a member of the leadership team and we will hook you up.<br>
            <br>
            We also offer our members the option of joining in with the NPSI  (Not Purple,  Shoot It)  fleets that some of our members participate in.  These are PVP based and usually involve flying out to Null Security space in a pre-determined ship looking for a fight.  These fleets are fully covered by SRP (Ship Replacement Program) by the group we fly with,  so you don't even need to worry about losing ISK.  Reach out to us in-game or on Discord for more info.</p>

            <h2>I'm new! How can I possibly contribute?</h2>
            <p>EVE Online is unique in that players with low skillpoints are not severely restricted on the activities they can do,  especially when it comes to participating in fleet activities.  The only barrier to doing so,  is commonly a lack of confidence or nerves,  neither of which should stand in your way.  If they are,  please speak to us so we can talk you through your options and help you make the most out of your time in-game.</p>
            <h3>Missions</h3>
            <p>Running Level 4 missions might seem impossible to newer players,  however,  when running in our fleets,  we provide logistics  (healing)  support as well as boosts that help to keep you alive.  Smaller ships,  such as the destroyers we hand out,  are valuable additions to our fleets because they can apply their damage to other small NPC targets much more efficiently than those of us running the larger ships.  This means that you are not just another number in the fleet,  but you are actually a valuable part of the fleet composition.</p>
            <h3>Mining</h3>
            <p>Mining in a group may seem overwhelming to newer players,  especially those that may be introverted or lack the confidence to speak up,  but given the opportunity,  you will soon see that it is the best way to mine.  Our mining FC's can explain everything you need to know,  such as what distance you need to be from the boosting ship,  which asteroids to mine for a particular mineral,  as well as tips on how to avoid being the target of a ganker.</p>
